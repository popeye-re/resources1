Study of Network devices in detail and connect the computers in Local Area Network.

AIM:Study of various network devices in detail All but the most basic of networks require devices to provide connectivity and functionality.Understanding how these networking devices operate and identifying the functions they performare essential skills for any network administrator and requirements for aNetwork+ candidate.Theall networkdevicesareexplained below:

Hubs:
The hub or network hub connects computers and devices and sends messages and data from anyonedeviceto all the others.Ifthedesktopcomputerwantstosenddatatothelappand it sends amessage to the laptop through the hub,the message willgetsentby the hub to all the computers and devices on the network.They need to do work to figure out that the message is not for them. The message also uses up bandwidth (room) on the network wires or wireless radiowavesandlimits howmuch communication can go on.Hubs arenot usedoften thesedays.

Switch:
The switch connects the computer network components but it is smart about it. It knows the address of each item and so when the desktop computer wants to talk to the laptop, it only sends the message to the laptop and nothing else. In order to have a small home network that just connects the local equipment all that is really needed is a switch and network cable or the 
switch can transmit wireless information that is received by wireless receivers that each of the network devices have.

Bridges:
Bridges are used to divide larger networks into smaller sections. They do this by sitting between two physical network segments and managing the flow of data between the two. By looking at the MAC address of the devices connected to each segment, bridges can elect to forward the data (if they believe that the destination address is on another interface), or block it from crossing (if they can verify that it is on the interface from which it came).
A bridge functions by blocking or forwarding data, based on the destination MAC address written into each frame of data. If the bridge believes the destination address is on a network other than that from which the data was received, it can forward the data to the other networks to which it is connected. If the address is not on the other side of the bridge, the data is blocked from passing. Bridges “learn” the MAC addresses of devices on connected networks by “listening” to network traffic and recording the network from which the traffic originates. Figure 3 shows a representation of a bridge.

Routers:
In a common configuration, routers are used to create larger networks by joining two network segments. A router derives its name from the fact that it can route data it receives from one network onto another. When a router receives a packet of data, it reads the header of the packet to determine the destination address. Once it has determined the address, it looks in its routing table to determine whether it knows how to reach the destination and, if it does, it forwards the packet to the next hop on the route. The next hop might be the final destination, or it might be another router. Figure 4 shows, in basic terms, how a router works.
The routing tables play a very important role in the routing process. They are the means by which the router makes its decisions. For this reason, a routing table needs to be two things. It must be up-to-date, and it must be complete. There are two ways that the router can get the information for the routing table—through static routing or dynamic routing.

Modem:
Most everyone wants to connect to the internet. A broadband modem is used to take a high speed Internet connection provided by an ISP (Internet Service Provider) and convert the data into a form that your local network can use. The high speed connection can be DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) from a phone company or cable from a cable television provider.
In order to be reached on the Internet, your computer needs a unique address on the internet. Your ISP will provide this to you as part of your Internet connection package. This address will generally not be fixed which means that they may change your address from time to time. For the vast majority of users, this makes no difference. If you have only one computer and want to connect to the Internet, you strictly speaking don't need a router. You can plug the network cable from the modem directly into the network connection of your computer. However, you are much better off connecting the modem to a router. The ip address your ISP provides will be assigned to the router.

2. i) Write a Program to implement the data 
link layer framing methods such as --> 
character stuffing. 
Character Stuffing : 
Character stuffing is also known as byte stuffing or 
character-oriented framing and is same as that of bit 
stuffing but byte stuffing actually operates on bytes 
whereas bit stuffing operates on bits. In byte stuffing, 
special byte that is basically known as ESC (Escape 
Character) that has predefined pattern is generally 
added to data section of the data stream or frame 
when there is message or character that has same 
pattern as that of flag byte. 
But receiver removes this ESC and keeps data part that 
causes some problems or issues. In simple words, we 
can say that character stuffing is addition of 1 
additional byte if there is presence of ESC or flag in text

2. ii) Write a Program to implement the data 
link layer framing methods such as --> bit 
stuffing. 
BitStuffing : 
Bit stuffing is also known as bit-oriented framing 
or bit-oriented approach. In bit stuffing, extra 
bits are being added by network protocol 
designers to data streams. It is generally 
insertion or addition of extra bits into 
transmission unit or message to be transmitted 
as simple way to provide and give signaling 
information and data to receiver and to avoid or 
ignore appearance of unintended or 
unnecessary control sequences.

Write a Program to implement data link layer framing method 
checksum. 
Description: 
 
Checksum is the error detection method used by upper-layer protocols and is 
considered to be more reliable than Longitudinal Redundancy Check (LRC), 
Vertical Redundancy Check (VRC), and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). This 
method uses a Checksum Generator on the sender side and a Checksum 
Checker on the receiver side.  
It is a unique number generated from data to verify its integrity. When data 
is created, a checksum is calculated and sent or saved with it. Later, when 
accessing the data, the checksum is recalculated. If the two checksums match, the 
data is likely error free. In this article we will see checksum error detection method 
in detail. 
On the Sender side, the data is divided into equal subunits of n bit length by the 
checksum generator. This bit is generally of 16-bit length. These subunits are then 
added together using one's complement method. This sum is of n bits. The resultant 
bit is then complemented. This complemented sum which is called checksum is 
appended to the end of the original data unit and is then transmitted to the 
receiver. The Receiver after receiving data + checksum passes it to checksum 
checker. Checksum checker divides this data unit into various subunits of equal 
length and adds all these subunits. These subunits also contain checksum as one of 
the subunits. The resultant bit is then complemented. If the complemented result is 
zero, it means the data is error-free. If the result is non-zero it means the data 

5. Write a Program to implement on a data set of characters the three CRC polynomials 
CRC 12, CRC 16 and CRC CCITT. 
Cyclic Redundancy Check  
Cyclic Redundancy Check or CRC is a method of detecting accidental changes/errors in the 
communication channel. CRC uses Generator Polynomial which is available on both sender and 
receiver 
side. 
An example generator polynomial is of the form like x3 + x + 1. This generator polynomial 
represents key 1011. Another example is x2 + 1 that represents key 101.  
There are two primary variables in CRC: 
 n: Number of bits in data to be sent from sender side 
 k: Number of bits in the key obtained from generator polynomial. 
Encoded Data Generation from Generator Polynomial (Sender Side) 
 The binary data is first augmented by adding k-1 zeros in the end of the data. 
 Then, modulo - 2 binary division is used to divide binary data by the key and remainder of 
division is stored. 
 At last the the remainder is appended at the end of the data to form the encoded data which is 
later sent. 
Checking Error in Transmission (Receiver Side) 
 After receiving the data, to check if the data is error free, perform the modulo-2 division 
again. 
 If the remainder is 0, then there are not errors, otherwise, the data is faulty and contain 
transmission errors. 
Modulo 2 Division 
The process of modulo-2 binary division is the same as the familiar division process we use for 
decimal numbers. Just that instead of subtraction, we use XOR here. 
 In each step, a copy of the divisor (or data) is XORed with the k bits of the dividend (or key). 
 The result of the XOR operation (remainder) is (k-1) bits, which is used for the next step 
after 1 extra bit is pulled down to make it k bits long. 
 When there are no bits left to pull down, we have a result. The (k-1) bit remainder which is 
appended at the sender side. 
Examples: 
Case 1: No error in transmission 
Data = 100100, Generator Polynomial (Key) = x3 + x2 + 1 (1101) 
Sender Side
